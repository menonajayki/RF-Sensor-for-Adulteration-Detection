# RF-Sensor-for-Adulteration-Detection
A fully functional C-Band Sensor was developed as part of the study. 90% aggreement between simulation results and lab results.
* HFSS and CST are used in simulation
* Lithography to etch the substrate with double sided copper metalization
* Network analyzer VNA Master 2026C by Anritsu used for lab testing
